# Range of Values

You can constrain the range of generated arbitrary values for certain parameters using the `@Min` and `@Max` annotations. These annotations allow you to set minimum and maximum bounds, respectively, ensuring that the generated values fall within the specified range.

## How to Use

To set the range for a parameter, simply annotate it with `@Min` to define the minimum value and `@Max` to define the maximum value.

Here's an example:

```java
@ParameterizedTest
@AutoSource
void testMethod(@Min(1) @Max(10) int value) {
    assertTrue(value >= 1);
    assertTrue(value <= 10);
}
```

In this test, the value parameter will always be an integer between `1` and `10`, inclusive.

## Supported types

The `@Min` and `@Max` annotations are compatible with the following types:

- `byte`
- `Byte`
- `short`
- `Short`
- `int`
- `Integer`
- `long`
- `Long`
- `float`
- `Float`
- `double`
- `Double`

## Benefits

1. **Controlled Randomness**: These annotations help you fine-tune the scope of randomness, allowing for more targeted and meaningful tests.
1. **Reduced Test Flakiness**: By constraining the range of values, you reduce the risk of encountering edge cases that could make your tests flaky.
1. **Enhanced Readability**: Using `@Min` and `@Max` makes it clear to readers what range of values are being tested, thereby improving the readability and maintainability of your test code.

By using the `@Min` and `@Max` annotations in conjunction with `@AutoSource`, you can achieve a balanced mix of randomness and predictability, making your parameterized tests both versatile and reliable.

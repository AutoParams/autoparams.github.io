# @Repeat

The `@Repeat` annotation in AutoParams provides you with a straightforward way to repeat a unit test multiple times, each time with newly generated, arbitrary test data. This can be particularly useful when you want to ensure that a piece of code functions as expected across a variety of input conditions.

## How to Use

To use the `@Repeat` feature, you'll need to attach the `@Repeat` annotation alongside the `@AutoSource` annotation on your parameterized test method. The repeat property of the `@Repeat` annotation takes an integer value, specifying the number of times the test should be repeated.

Here's an example:

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock>
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@AutoSource
@Repeat(10)
void testMethod(int a, int b) {
    // This test method will be executed ten times with different sets of 'a' and 'b' each time.
    Calculator sut = new Calculator();
    int actual = sut.add(a, b);
    assertEquals(a + b, actual);
}
```

```kotlin

```
</JavaKotlinCodeBlock>

In the example above, the test method testMethod will run ten times. Each run will have a new set of randomly generated values for a and b, thanks to the `@AutoSource` annotation. The `@Repeat(10)` ensures that this cycle happens ten times, enhancing the test coverage.

## Benefits

1. **Diverse Test Data**: The `@Repeat` feature allows you to test your methods across a wider range of automatically generated input values.
1. **Reduced Manual Effort**: There's no need to manually specify multiple sets of test data or create loops within your tests.
1. **Increased Test Robustness**: Repeating tests multiple times with varying data can uncover edge cases and improve the reliability of your software.

By using the `@Repeat` feature, you can increase the comprehensiveness and reliability of your test suite with minimal additional effort.

# `ResolutionContext` class

The [`ResolutionContext`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.github.autoparams/autoparams/11.0.1/autoparams/ResolutionContext.html) class provides the core mechanism for generating test data. While it is used internally by AutoParams, you can also instantiate and use it directly in your own test code when needed.

Here's an example:

<JavaKotlinCodeBlock>
```java
@Test
void testMethod() {
    ResolutionContext context = new ResolutionContext();
    Product product = context.resolve();
    Review review = context.resolve();
}
```

```kotlin
@Test
fun testMethod() {
    val context = ResolutionContext()
    val product = context.resolve<Product>()
    val review = context.resolve<Review>()
}
```
</JavaKotlinCodeBlock>

In this example, `ResolutionContext` is used to manually generate instances of `Product` and `Review` outside of the `@AutoParams` annotation. This offers more control and flexibility for writing custom test logic or handling special cases.
